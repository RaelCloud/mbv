<h3>Introduction Electricity Outage in Nigeria</h3>
<p>Electricity supply in Nigeria has been a critical issue affecting economic development and quality of life. 
    Despite being endowed with abundant natural resources, including oil, gas, and renewable energy potential, the country struggles with a chronic power supply crisis.
     The electricity sector in Nigeria has been characterized by inconsistent supply, frequent outages, and inadequate infrastructure, which collectively hinder industrial growth, small business operations, and overall economic stability.
    Historically, the challenges in the electricity sector stem from a combination of factors, including insufficient investment in generation and distribution, aging infrastructure, regulatory issues, and corruption. The privatization of the power sector in 2013 was intended to attract investment and improve efficiency; however, progress has been slow, and many Nigerians still experience prolonged outages. The impact of these outages extends beyond inconvenience, affecting businesses, healthcare services, education, and daily life.
    Moreover, the reliance on alternative energy sources, such as generators, has significant economic implications, contributing to increased living costs and environmental concerns.
     Understanding the dynamics of electricity outages in Nigeria is vital for developing effective policies and interventions aimed at enhancing power supply reliability and fostering economic growth.
This study aims to investigate the frequency, causes, and effects of electricity outages in Nigeria, focusing on their implications for households and businesses.
 By analyzing these aspects, the research seeks to contribute to the existing body of knowledge and inform stakeholders about potential solutions to improve electricity supply in the country.

    <h3> What is an Electricity</h3> 

    <p>Electricity is the set of physical phenomena associated with the presence and motion of matter possessing an electric charge.
         Electricity is related to magnetism, both being part of the phenomenon of electromagnetism, as described by Maxwell's equations.
          Common phenomena are related to electricity, including lightning, static electricity, electric heating, electric discharges and many others.</p>
